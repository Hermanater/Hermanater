Cooper Herman, aka Hermanater

I'm a part-time, self-imployed game developer with a love for code and business logic. Looking for internship opportunities in business system management and customization, and would love to publish work in the game or general software fields prior to or during this.

Would also be interested in joining a game devlopment team/studio in various degrees of income (salary, wage, game profits). I have roughly 4 years in the game development industry and am working on a project to add to my portfolio. If asked, I can provide you with any and all previous works of mine.
